/*
Clock Program:

Hr, Min, Sec

Constructors to handle: default, (4, 15, 6), (1,30), (14), (clock1)

Overload <<, >> ++,<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=

Get and Set methods.

Write a tester program that creates 2 clocks(Input from the user). The first clock will 
represent the real time and one will represent your alarm clock. Do a loop that will 
continue to add 1 second to the current time and stop when it reaches the alarm clock time. 
Display the time each second on the screen. 

You can use  system("CLS"); to clear the screen each time so it looks like it is overwriting the current time.

#include <stdlib.h>

void main()
{
   system("cls");
}
