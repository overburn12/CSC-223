/*
Create a class called "Maze" that includes a recursive call to find a path through a 
given text maze. The first 2 lines in the text file represent the size of the maze and 
the the next 2 lines represent the starting location in the maze. A sample text file is attached.

I will test your program on a similar text file.    maze.txt


1.) You will first have to set up tp read in  the maze text file.

2.) You must dynamically create a 2-dimensional character array.

3.) Write a recursive method to "find your way" through the maze. 
    (Each recursive call will represent one move in the maze)

**Think of the base case(s), then what would you look for next. This is not a long program, but a logic program. 

***There is many solutions to this, but make sure what you submit is your own.

**** Remember to copy your code into a word document and submit that document for a grade.
